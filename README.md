# To-do

### Login
- [ ] Add a forgot email password flow
- [ ] Make social login work
- [ ] Error validation for wrong username/password

### Top Nav
- [ ] Make a spot in the db to upload a profile img

### Sign Up
- [ ] Add a validation for when a user is registering and the email already exist or the password is not up to standards
- [ ] Implement email login

### Dashboard
- [ ] Fix the colors of the dashboard since implementing dark mode is making everything blend together
- [ ] Fix top nav to have user profile, settings, and notification
- [ ] Make the sidebar be on top of the topNavBar and implement the expand and collapse
- [ ] Make sure that the sidebar is full height since right now is not the right size. 
- [ ] Add a toggle for darkmode and light mode
- [ ] Make the footer smaller

### General
- [ ] Look into bringing the colors i have on the figma design i am thinking that would be the "dark mode" and not the default bs color
